# Customization

Lowkode generates a UI from Metadata, Components, Rules, and Context
- Metadata: Data that describes the system that the UI fronts.  
	This includes schemas for objects, available services, UI contributions, etc.
- Rules:  Rules modify a Context given some, optional, data.
	Rules are used, for example, to globally replace the component used to display dates, or make the SSN field on the Employee form required for certain companies.
- Components: UI elements that display objects.
	The exact display generated by a component is influenced by Metadata, Customization, and Context
- Context:  Runtime data and service provider injected into every Component that provides access to Metadata and other Components.
	A Context is a kind of service provider.  A new Context can be created from an existing Context, the Metadata and Components provided by the 
	new Context may be different from that provided by the parent Context, depending onthe data used to construct the new Context.
