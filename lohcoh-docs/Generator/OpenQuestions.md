## How to manage Context?
Background:  LowKode uses a metadata repository to store the metadata, components then use that metadata to generate content.  

## Is it possible to create a Form component that you can inject form fields into?
	Seems like it's a mistake to make the rendering of a form dependent on the shape of some model object, because forms sometimes 
	need to be an aggregate of data items from several entity types, and being bound to the shape of some design-time 
	model totally doesn't work.


## DataLog (a deductive database) is exactly the kind of system that should be used to manage metadata
Can a simple, C#-oriented library be implemented?
