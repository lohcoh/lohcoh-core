## extended components
Data Tables (should be in the free project?)
Layouts (should definitely be in the free project, is needed for forms)

Search Filters UI + Query API 
	The idea here is to provide a metadata-driven GraphQL-like query facility along with search filter UI that enables users to 
	filter search results or even create ad-hoc reports.

Tailwind-like Marketing and ECommerce components; 
Cards
Lists

## built with lowkode
- admin panel, generated from a variety of metadata sources.

- User Admin extension for LowKode apps.

- Autocomplete extension
	Remembers the values entered into fields by users and uses those past values to provide autocomplete.

- Preferences UI extension
	A UI for configuring user preferences.
	Enables developers to declare Configuration entities, lowKode generates the UI. 
	Configuration is UI only, not for business rules.  
	Configuration is available via Context, can be used with Rules to customize LowKode UI.

- Tag UI extension
	Would it be possible to create an extension that would automaginally add tags to 
	LowKode forms, without extending the underlying Entities? 
	And, if they have the LowKode Search extension, automagically use tags to find data?

## for developers
- Visual Studio extension that provides a generated UI for 
	- project configuration artifacts.
	- Entity relationships
