## library plugins

LowKode will *NOT* provide support for commercial component libraies out of the box but will instead sell packages for them.

	Free...
		Blazorize
		Razden
	Commercial...
		SyncFusion
		Telerik
		DevExpress


## extended components
Data Tables (should be in the free project?)
Layouts (should definitely be in the free project, is needed for forms)

Search Filters UI + Query API 
	The idea here is to provide a metadata-driven GraphQL-like query facility along with search filter UI that enables users to 
	filter search results or even create ad-hoc reports.

Tailwind-like or PatternFly UI elements; 
Cards
Lists
