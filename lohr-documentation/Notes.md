Here are a couple of facts that I take as axiomatic...
- For a variety of reasons, there is currently a growing demand for 'low code' and 'no code' development tools, and I wish to create such a tool and get rich :-).
- In the world of Agile software development, User Stories are a very popular method of describing software features from an end user's perspective.

It is theoretically possible to create a 'low code' or 'no code' development tool that can dynamically execute 
users stories that describe a 'line of business' application written in a 'controlled natural language'. 
	Such a tool could also be used to generate a complete application in a given programming language.
